# Wine Shop Inventory - Backend Database Setup

## 🗄️ Database Migration Complete

Your wine shop inventory system has been successfully migrated from in-memory storage to **PostgreSQL database** for persistent data storage.

## ✨ What Changed

### Before (Memory Storage)
- Data stored in `appData` object
- Data lost on server restart
- No data persistence
- Limited scalability

### After (PostgreSQL Database)
- **Persistent data storage** - survives server restarts
- **Multi-user support** - each shop has isolated data
- **Data integrity** - proper relationships and constraints
- **Scalability** - can handle multiple shops and large datasets
- **Backup & recovery** - standard database backup procedures

## 🏗️ Database Schema

### Tables Created
1. **`users`** - Shop owner accounts
2. **`shop_inventory`** - Products in each shop
3. **`daily_stock_records`** - Daily stock tracking
4. **`invoices`** - Purchase invoice records

### Key Features
- **Automatic timestamps** - `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Proper indexing** - Fast queries on common fields
- **Data validation** - Ensures data consistency
- **Foreign key relationships** - Maintains data integrity

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Environment Variables
Set up your PostgreSQL connection:

```bash
# Option 1: Connection string
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database

# Option 2: Individual variables
PGHOST=localhost
PGPORT=5432
PGDATABASE=wine_shop_inventory
PGUSER=your_username
PGPASSWORD=your_password
```

### 2. Database Setup
The system automatically:
- Connects to PostgreSQL
- Creates tables if they don't exist
- Sets up proper indexes
- Validates connection

### 3. Test Database Connection
Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
cd backend
node test-db.js
```

## 🔧 Database Service Layer

### New Architecture
- **`databaseService.js`** - Handles all database operations
- **Clean separation** - Business logic separate from data access
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive error management
- **Transaction support** - Ready for complex operations

### Key Methods
- `createUser()` - User registration
- `addShopProduct()` - Add products to shop
- `createOrUpdateDailyStockRecord()` - Stock management
- `getSummary()` - Business analytics
- `saveInvoice()` - Invoice processing

## 📊 Data Flow

### User Registration
1. User submits registration form
2. Password hashed with bcrypt
3. User data saved to `users` table
4. JWT token generated for authentication

### Inventory Management
1. Products added to `shop_inventory`
2. Daily stock records created automatically
3. Stock continuity maintained across dates
4. Real-time calculations for sales and values

### Invoice Processing
1. PDF uploaded and parsed
2. Products validated against master brands
3. Stock updated with received quantities
4. Invoice saved to database for audit trail

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Database Operations
```bash
# Test all database functions
node test-db.js

# Test specific endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test","email":"test@example.com","password":"password","shopName":"Test Shop"}'
```

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Password hashing** - bcrypt with salt rounds
- **JWT authentication** - Secure token-based auth
- **User isolation** - Each shop sees only their data
- **SQL injection protection** - Parameterized queries
- **Input validation** - Data sanitization

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- **Database indexes** - Fast lookups on common fields
- **Connection pooling** - Efficient database connections
- **Query optimization** - Efficient SQL queries
- **Lazy loading** - Load data only when needed

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Failed**
   - Check environment variables
   - Verify PostgreSQL is running
   - Check network connectivity

2. **Tables Not Created**
   - Check database permissions
   - Verify database exists
   - Check error logs

3. **Data Not Persisting**
   - Verify database connection
   - Check for transaction rollbacks
   - Verify data is being saved

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting:
```bash
DEBUG=true
```
