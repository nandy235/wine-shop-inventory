# 🌍 **Real-World Authentication Scenarios**

## **What Actually Happens When Things Go Wrong**

Let's walk through each scenario with concrete examples showing exactly what the user sees and experiences.

---

## 🔐 **Scenario 1: Auth Expired - "Seamless Recovery"**

### **What Happens:**
User has been working in the app for 25 hours. Their session expired, but they don't know it yet.

### **User Action:**
```
User clicks "Save Stock Changes" button
```

### **Behind the Scenes:**
```javascript
// 1. User clicks save
const handleSave = async () => {
  setLoading(true);
  
  // 2. API call is made
  const response = await apiPost('/api/stock/update', stockData);
  //    ↓
  // 3. Server responds: 401 Unauthorized (session expired)
  //    ↓
  // 4. apiUtils detects 401, automatically calls refresh
  const refreshSuccess = await handleTokenRefresh();
  //    ↓
  // 5. Refresh succeeds, original request is retried
  const retryResponse = await apiPost('/api/stock/update', stockData);
  //    ↓
  // 6. Retry succeeds with 200 OK
  
  setLoading(false);
  showSuccess("Stock updated successfully!");
};
```

### **User Experience:**
```
User clicks "Save Stock Changes"
   ↓
Loading spinner shows for 2-3 seconds (slightly longer than usual)
   ↓
"Stock updated successfully!" message appears
   ↓
User continues working, completely unaware their session expired
```

### **What User Sees:**
- ✅ **No error messages**
- ✅ **No login prompts**  
- ✅ **Just a slightly longer loading time**
- ✅ **Operation completes successfully**

---

## 🌐 **Scenario 2: Network Error - "Automatic Retry"**

### **What Happens:**
User is on unstable WiFi. Their internet connection drops for 2 seconds while making a request.

### **User Action:**
```
User uploads an invoice PDF file
```

### **Behind the Scenes:**
```javascript
// 1. User selects file and clicks upload
const handleUpload = async () => {
  setUploading(true);
  setError(null);
  
  try {
    // 2. Upload starts
    const response = await secureFileUpload('/api/upload-invoice', formData);
    //    ↓
    // 3. Network connection drops - fetch throws NetworkError
    //    ↓
    // 4. apiUtils catches error, waits 2 seconds, retries automatically
    console.warn('File upload failed, retrying... (1/2)');
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
    //    ↓
    // 5. Network is back, retry succeeds
    const retryResponse = await secureFileUpload('/api/upload-invoice', formData);
    
    setUploading(false);
    setSuccess("Invoice uploaded successfully!");
    
  } catch (error) {
    setUploading(false);
    setError("Upload failed. Please try again.");
  }
};
```

### **User Experience:**
```
User clicks "Upload Invoice"
   ↓
Progress bar starts: "Uploading... 45%"
   ↓
Progress pauses briefly (network drops)
   ↓
Console shows: "File upload failed, retrying... (1/2)" 
   ↓
Progress resumes: "Uploading... 78%"
   ↓
"Invoice uploaded successfully!" appears
```

### **What User Sees:**
- ✅ **Upload completes successfully**
- ✅ **Brief pause in progress (2-3 seconds)**
- ✅ **No error messages**
- ✅ **Automatic recovery**

---

## ⏱️ **Scenario 3: Timeout - "Clear Feedback"**

### **What Happens:**
Server is overloaded and takes 15 seconds to respond. Client has 10-second timeout.

### **User Action:**
```
User clicks "Generate Sales Report" for a large date range
```

### **Behind the Scenes:**
```javascript
// 1. User clicks generate report
const generateReport = async () => {
  setLoading(true);
  setError(null);
  
  try {
    // 2. Request starts with 10-second timeout
    const controller = new AbortController();
    const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 10000);
    
    const response = await fetch('/api/reports/sales', {
      signal: controller.signal,
      // ... other options
    });
    //    ↓
    // 3. 10 seconds pass, request is aborted
    // 4. AbortError is thrown
    //    ↓
    // 5. apiUtils detects AbortError - NO RETRY (timeouts aren't retried)
    
  } catch (error) {
    setLoading(false);
    if (error.message.includes('timeout')) {
      setError('Request timed out - the server may be slow. Please try again.');
    }
  }
};
```

### **User Experience:**
```
User clicks "Generate Sales Report"
   ↓
Loading spinner shows for exactly 10 seconds
   ↓
Error message appears: "Request timed out - the server may be slow. Please try again."
   ↓
User can click "Try Again" button to retry manually
```

### **What User Sees:**
- ❌ **Clear timeout message**
- ✅ **No automatic retry** (prevents server overload)
- ✅ **Option to retry manually**
- ✅ **Knows exactly what happened**

## 🔥 **Scenario 4: Server Error - "Graceful Degradation"**

### **What Happens:**
Database connection fails on the server while user is trying to save data.

### **User Action:**
```
User fills out "Add New Product" form and clicks "Save"
```

### **Behind the Scenes:**
```javascript
// 1. User submits form
const handleSubmit = async () => {
  setSubmitting(true);
  setErrors({});
  
  try {
    // 2. API call is made
    const response = await apiPost('/api/products', formData);
    //    ↓
    // 3. Server database connection fails
    // 4. Server returns 500 Internal Server Error
    //    ↓
    // 5. apiUtils detects 500 - NO RETRY (server errors aren't retried)
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorData = await response.json();
      setErrors({ general: errorData.message });
    }
    
  } catch (error) {
    setSubmitting(false);
    setErrors({ 
      general: 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.' 
    });
  }
};
```

### **User Experience:**
```
User clicks "Save Product"
   ↓
Loading spinner shows for 2-3 seconds
   ↓
Error message appears: "Database connection failed. Please try again later."
   ↓
Form data is preserved (user doesn't lose their work)
   ↓
User can try again in a few minutes
```

### **What User Sees:**
- ❌ **Clear error message**
- ✅ **Form data preserved**
- ✅ **No automatic retry** (server needs time to recover)
- ✅ **Helpful guidance** ("try again later")

## 🔄 **Complex Scenario: Multiple Issues**

### **What Happens:**
User's session expires AND they have network issues.

### **User Action:**
```
User (who's been idle for 25 hours) tries to update closing stock
```

### **Behind the Scenes:**
```javascript
const updateStock = async () => {
  setLoading(true);
  
  // 1. First attempt: 401 (session expired)
  const response1 = await apiPost('/api/stock/closing', data);
  // → Auth refresh happens automatically
  
  // 2. Auth refresh succeeds, retry original request
  const response2 = await apiPost('/api/stock/closing', data);
  // → Network error occurs during retry
  
  // 3. Network error caught, wait 1 second, retry again
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  const response3 = await apiPost('/api/stock/closing', data);
  // → Success!
  
  setLoading(false);
  showSuccess("Closing stock updated!");
};
```

### **User Experience:**
```
User clicks "Update Closing Stock"
   ↓
Loading spinner shows for 4-5 seconds (longer than usual)
   ↓
Console shows: "Network error, retrying... (1/2)"
   ↓
"Closing stock updated!" message appears
   ↓
User continues working normally
```

### **What User Sees:**
- ✅ **Operation succeeds despite multiple issues**
- ✅ **Slightly longer loading time**
- ✅ **No error messages**
- ✅ **Completely seamless experience**

## 📱 **Real Mobile Scenarios**

### **Scenario: User on Train with Spotty Connection**

```
User is on a train, connection keeps dropping every 30 seconds
```

**What Happens:**
1. **Good connection**: Requests work normally
2. **Connection drops**: Network errors are automatically retried
3. **Connection returns**: Retries succeed
4. **Session expires**: Automatic refresh + retry
5. **User experience**: App "just works" despite terrible network

### **Scenario: User in Coffee Shop with Slow WiFi**

```
User is in a busy coffee shop, WiFi is very slow
```

**What Happens:**
1. **Small requests**: Complete within 10-second timeout
2. **Large file uploads**: Get 30-second timeout, usually succeed
3. **Very slow requests**: Timeout with clear message, user can retry
4. **User experience**: Clear feedback about what's happening

---

## 🎯 **What This Actually Achieves**

### **1. Invisible Reliability**
```
Instead of: "Session expired, please log in again"
User gets: Seamless operation with slightly longer loading
```

### **2. Smart Recovery**
```
Instead of: "Network error, operation failed"
User gets: Automatic retry with success
```

### **3. Clear Communication**
```
Instead of: Generic "Error occurred"
User gets: "Request timed out - server may be slow. Try again."
```

### **4. Preserved Work**
```
Instead of: Lost form data and frustrated user
User gets: Error message with form data intact
```

### **5. Production Resilience**
```
Instead of: App breaking under real-world conditions
User gets: Reliable app that handles network issues gracefully
```

## 📊 **User Impact Comparison**

### **❌ Without Smart Retry Logic:**
```
User Action: Save inventory data
Result: "Session expired. Please log in again."
User Impact: 
- Loses current work
- Has to log in again  
- Has to re-enter data
- Frustrated experience
- Might abandon the task
```

### **✅ With Smart Retry Logic:**
```
User Action: Save inventory data  
Result: "Inventory saved successfully!"
User Impact:
- Work is saved automatically
- Continues working seamlessly
- Doesn't even know there was an issue
- Positive experience
- Stays productive
```
